# Outline
I made this repository to learn [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](https://railstutorial.jp/)

# About Ruby on Rails Tutorial
At the time of writing, the latest version is the 4th.


# Development Environment
I use [the former Cloud9](https://ide.c9.io/) instead of AWS Cloud9.
It's because some people like me have already run out of free trial of AWS.

# Tips
1. This README document is still under writing.
2. Any question or comment is welcome. Please create a PR, an issue or a comment.
